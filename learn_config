#This configuration file aids the learning process by tweaking
#the learning algorithm for specific paths.
#
#It accepts lines in the form of <command> <pathname>
#Where <command> can be inherit-learn, no-learn, or inherit-no-learn.
#
#inherit-learn changes the learning process for the specified path
#by throwing all learned accesses for every binary executed by the
#processes contained in the pathname into the subject specified
#by the pathname.  This is useful for cron in the case of full
#system learning, so that scripts that eventually end up executing
#mv or rm with privilege don't cause the root policy to grant
#that privilege to mv or rm in all cases.
#
#no-learn allows processes within the path to perform any operation
#that normal system usage would allow without restriction.  If
#a process is generating a huge number of learning logs, it may be
#best to use this command on that process and configure its policy
#manually.
#
#inherit-no-learn combines the above two cases, such that processes
#within the specified path will be able to perform any normal system
#operation without restriction as will any binaries executed by
#these processes.
